# vivohomebridge
## Introduction
[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md) | [English](./README_EN.md) 

**vivohomebridge** is an integration running on **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)**, with the following main functions:
 - It maps devices (entities) connected to the HA platform into the vivo IoT ecosystem.
 - Enables seamless integration with vivo‚Äôs IoT ecosystem, allowing users to manage these devices through vivo‚Äôs system capabilities ‚Äî such as **JoviInLife App**, **Connection Center**, **BlueLM Copilot**, and **Shortcut Commands** ‚Äî for a unified and smooth vivo IoT experience.

## Integration Advantages
- **Break the ecosystem barrier:** Seamlessly synchronize devices from the HA platform (regardless of brand) to the vivo JoviInLife app.

- **Unified control experience:** Manage all HA-connected devices directly within the main interface of vivo JoviInLife app, achieving a truly unified smart home experience.

- **Remote control:** vivo provides cloud-based device control, allowing you to remotely control your devices once connected to the vivo ecosystem.

- **System-level integration (for vivo phones):** vivo deeply integrates with Home Assistant at the system level, meaning you can access and control HA devices directly from system settings ‚Äî such as voice control, Connection Center, and Shortcut Commands.

- **Convenient intelligent automation (for vivo phones):** Leverage  vivo JoviInLife automation capabilities to easily build cross-brand, cross-ecosystem smart scenarios and automations.

## Integration Download and Installation

### Download Methods

#### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)
- You can manually add the GitHub repository URL to HACS, and then download it via HACS.
- It will later be submitted to the HACS official default repository, allowing direct search and installation.
- searchÔºö`vivohomebridge`
#### Method 2: Git
Download the integration using the `git` command in your terminal:
Navigate to the HA `config/custom_components` directory, then run:
```sh
cd config/custom_components
git clone https://github.com/vivo/ha_vivohomebridge.git
```
Then copy the `vivohomebridge` folder (located in `ha_vivohomebridge/custom_components`) to the `config/custom_components` directory in Home Assistant.
**And Restart Home Assistant**.
#### Method 3: Samba / FTPS (File Transfer)
1. Download the latest version ZIP from https://github.com/vivo/ha_vivohomebridge
2. Unzip the file, Then copy the `vivohomebridge` folder (located in `ha_vivohomebridge/custom_components`) to the `config/custom_components` directory in Home Assistant.
3. **Restart Home Assistant**.

### Installation
In the `Home Assistant` UI:
‚öôÔ∏è Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > üîç Search for "vivo" or "vivohomebridge", then follow the prompts to complete installation by clicking Next until Finish, as shown below:

## Integration Usage
Before use, you must first bind the integration via the **vivo JoviInLife app**.
There are two scenarios with slightly different binding methods:
1. When your Home Assistant and smartphone are on the same local network.
2. When your Home Assistant and smartphone are not on the same network (eg: HA runs in Docker) or you are using a non-vivo phone.

### Case 1: Home Assistant and Phone on the Same Local Network

**Note:** This method only supports vivo phones.

### Case 2: Home Assistant and Phone Not on the Same Network or Using a Non-vivo Phone

**Note:** Supports both vivo and non-vivo phones.
